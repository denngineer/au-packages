    <description>The CEFIC Emergency Response Intervention Cards (ERICards or ERICâ€™s) provide guidance on initial actions for fire crews when they first arrive at the scene of a chemical transport accident without having appropriate and reliable product specific emergency information at hand.

ERICards are intended for fire crews, trained in chemical emergency response, and contain information and procedures that may require specialised equipment.

ERICards are intended to deal with chemical accidents involving a substantial amount of product, occurring during land transport only and may therefore not be appropriate for accidents in other situations.

ERICards apply to a group of products, and hence can never be a substitute for the specific product information obtained from a reliable source (e.g. safety data sheet, reference databases or industry experts). Using ERICards therefore always requires sound judgement, taking into account the particular circumstances of each accident.</description>
